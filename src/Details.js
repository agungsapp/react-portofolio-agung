  about: `Hello, I'm Agung Saputra, an enthusiastic and innovative website developer. I have a background in Computer Engineering and have demonstrated expertise in developing modern web technologies. As a Full Stack Developer, I have successfully delivered innovative solutions, including an engaging e-commerce platform. One of my recent projects involved developing an e-commerce platform for PT. Tunas Honda. In this project, I utilized technologies such as Bootstrap for responsive design, Laravel for robust backend development, and MySql for efficient database management. Additionally, I have experience in using other technologies such as React.js and Next.js to build dynamic and efficient user interfaces, as well as non-relational databases like Mongo DB to support scalability and speed in web application development. I enjoy learning new technologies and am always ready to apply my knowledge and skills to tackle new challenges. The trust placed in me is a great honor and motivation to consistently deliver the best in every project.`,
